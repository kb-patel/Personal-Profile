        <h2>Previous Projects</h2>
        <p>Below is some of the work I have carried out, using the skills and knowledge gained from learning about web development so far.</p>

        <h3>Innovative Beauty Lab</h3>
        <img src="images/innovative-beauty-website.jpg" alt="Image of Innovative Beauty website home page.">
        <p>During 2016 I built a full website for the owner of Innovative Beauty Lab, formerly known as Beauty Brands International.  The purpose of the final website is to advertise the products the company sells.  It also enables email enquiries to be made through a contact form.  The page designs were created in Adobe Photoshop using grids to create responsive layouts.  Then using the Bootstrap framework (including HTML5, CSS3) and PHP, I coded a responsive and dynamic website optimised for viewing on a range of devices.  The contact form was created by editing existing code from an online example, written using JQuery, AJAX and PHP.</p>

        <h3>Beauty Brands International</h3>
        <img src="images/bbi-mini-site.jpg" alt="Image of Beauty Brands International mini-site home page.">
        <p>Towards the end of 2015 I was approached by the owner of a local business, called Beauty Brands International, to design a website to advertise their product range.  As the company did not have a website initially, my first project was to develop a mini site to provide an online presence. The mini site was developed using the Bootstrap responsive framework, along with HTML5 and CSS3, to create a layout and style suitable for a range of devices. PHP was also used to include common code snippets into all the website pages without writing the same code multiple times.</p>

        <h3>Gellwig Residential Centre</h3>
        <img src="images/gelliwig-website.jpg" alt="Image of Gellwig Residential Centre website home page.">
        <p>After my previous work with the Birch Thompson Memorial Fund, I came across a HTML and CSS course on Udemy. The course provided me with the knowledge and experience to redesign the fund's website. The main aim of this work was to create a modern and user friendly design.  The entire site was coded in HTML and CSS, with a navigation bar constructed using modified code from CSS Deck.  Currently, I update and add to the website’s content as requested by the charity.</p>

        <h3>The New Birch Thompson Memorial Fund</h3>
        <img src="images/new-btmf-website.png" alt="Image of the New Birch Thompson Memorial Fund website home page.">
        <p>My interest in web development came from an opportunity provided through my voluntary work with the Birch Thompson Memorial Fund.  The main objective was to redesign and update the layout and content of the current website.  Using Adobe Dreamweaver CS5 and relevant literature I was able to create a simple design.  At the time however the charity wanted to concentrate on updating the content currently on the website.</p>
